Release Notes
-------------------

Nessus 1.0.0 Beta3 is a major upgrade to our blockchain + [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/#why) functionality.   
 
In good IPFS style, we provide a walk through the functionality here: [TODO]
 
Most noteworthy new features are ...

* [#69][69] Add support for directory upload
* [#83][83] Replace file lists with tree views
* [#105][105] Make address registration idempotent

* [#95][95] Add support for registered user meta data
* [#111][111] Provide a data only blockstore image
* [#121][121] Provide direct IPFS access in UI layer

* [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/)
* [WildFly-Camel](http://wildfly-extras.github.io/wildfly-camel/) 
* [Aegeus](https://aegeus.io/) 

In addition to that, we also resolved a number of other [tasks and bugs](https://github.com/jboss-fuse/nessus/blob/master/docs/Changelog.md).
